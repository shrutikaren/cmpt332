<title>Context Switches</title>
<h1>Context Switches</h1>
<ul>
<li>A <i>context switch</i> is when the CPU is switched from one process to another.</li>
<li>For the process being suspended, all of the following must be taken care of:
<ul>
<li>We need to record enough info regarding the process, so that we can resume its execution at some later time.</li>
<li>Where is this info when the program is running? In the process control block for that process, of course.</li>
<li>The main memory occupied by the process (code and data) must either not be altered while the program is suspended, or must be saved (to disc).</li>
<li>The process' stack, including local variables, return addresses, subroutine parameters, and other saved registers, must not be touched, or saved.</li>
<li>The stack pointer register (the current location in the process' stack), and the program counter "register" must be saved in the process' PCB.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To reactivate a process, these saved values are reloaded, with the program counter being loaded last of all. (For somewhat obvious reasons, given that most computers only have one PC!)

</li>
<li>The time required to perform a context switch is PURE OVERHEAD; no constructive work is getting done during a context switch - no processes are running.</li>
</ul>
