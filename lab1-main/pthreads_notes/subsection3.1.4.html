<P>
Pthreads provides two memory allocation systems. These are the <em> temporary</em>
and <em> permanent</em> systems.
<P>
The permanent system allocates memory with calls to Malloc(), Realloc(), and
Free(). Memory allocated in this way is permanent is the sense that the memory 
can exist beyond the lifetime of the allocating process. Such memory remains 
allocated until it is explicitly released with a call to Free(). Pthreads uses 
a very fast (near O(1)) memory allocation scheme. The headers for Malloc() and
Free() are as follows:
<P>
<PRE><TT>void *Malloc(int size)
<P>
void *Realloc( void *ptr, int size )
<P>
void Free( void *mem )</TT></PRE>
<P>
<em> Malloc()</em> requires as its single parameter the size, in bytes, of the
requested contiguous memory segment. On success, Malloc() returns the address of
the allocated segment. On failure, NULL is returned.
<P>
<em> Realloc()</em> expands or contracts a previously allocated memory segment by
freeing the initial segment and allocating a new one. It requires two 
parameters. The first is a pointer to the existing memory segment.  The second 
is the size of the desired segment. Realloc() copies the contents of the 
existing segment to the new segment to the extent of the smaller of the two.
Realloc() returns a pointer to the new segment.
<P>
<em> Free()</em> returns a previously allocated segment to the system. The single
parameter to Free() is the address of the first byte of the segment to be
returned. Free() returns no values.
<P>
The temporary memory allocation system is designed for the management of complex
data structures. These data structures are often composed of many individual
segments. The temporary memory facility allows these individual segments
to be managed and freed as a group. This facility also avoids the potential
internal fragmentation and overhead problems associated with allocating a large 
number of very small (1+ byte) segments.
<P>
Each Pthreads process has its own stack of <em> memory frames</em>. Each memory
frame groups a set of associated memory segments. A frame can be transferred
from one process to another, or freed as a unit. Typically, all the segments
that comprise a single data structure would be allocated on one frame. This
entire data structure could then be transferred to another process or freed 
with single library calls. When a process leaves the system, all the memory
on its frame stack is returned to the system. The headers of the subroutines 
which operate on temporary memory are as follows:
<P>
<PRE><TT>void NewFrame()
<P>
void FreeFrame()
<P>
void SwapFrame()
<P>
void *PopFrame()
<P>
void PushFrame( void *frame )
<P>
int TransferTempMem( PID topid )
<P>
void *TempMalloc( int size )
<P>
void FreeTempMem()</TT></PRE>
<P>
NewFrame() requires no parameters and returns no result. It creates a new 
memory frame and pushes it onto the calling thread's memory frame stack.
<P>
FreeFrame() also requires no parameters and returns no result. It 
frees all memory associated with the calling process' top memory frame, pops 
the frame and discards it.
<P>
SwapFrame()
swaps the top two memory frames of the calling process. If zero or one
frames exist for this process then SwapFrame() has no effect.
<P>
PopFrame()
pops and returns a pointer to the top memory frame of the calling process.
This routine should be used with caution, generally in conjunction with
PushFrame(). The reason for caution is that a memory frame which is not
currently on any process' memory stack is essentially an orphan. This memory
will not be returned to the system should its creator or owner exit.
<P>
PushFrame() takes a pointer to a frame and pushes it on the calling
thread's memory stack. The PopFrame() / PushFrame() pair can be used to transfer
per-process memory from one process to another, or to perform stack
rearrangement functions. Note that a stack frame which does not currently
reside on any process' stack is in danger of becoming uncollectable garbage.
Note that a memory frame cannot exist on more than one memory
stack at a time. If an application wishes to move the top memory frame from
one process to another, this may be done using PopFrame(), PushFrame() and
inter-process communication, but it is preferable to use TransferTempMem()
instead.
<P>
TransferTempMem() requires the single argument <em> topid</em>. This
operation transfers the top memory frame of the calling process to the top of
the memory stack of process <em> topid</em>. This routine avoids the time interval
between a PopFrame() and a PushFrame() when a memory frame does not belong to
any process. TransferTempMem() returns 0 on success, or -1 on failure( eg. if
an invalid argument is encountered).
<P>
TempMalloc() takes an integer parameter <em> size</em>. This routine allocates
memory from the top memory frame of the calling process. This memory cannot
be released using Free(). Temporary memory is returned to the system
using FreeFrame() (discussed previously) or FreeTempMem(). An important feature
of TempMalloc() is that if no memory frame currently exists on the calling
process' memory stack, a new one is created and pushed automatically. In this 
case, the allocated memory is taken from the new frame.
<P>
FreeTempMem() returns no values and requires no parameters. It returns the 
calling process' temporary memory (from all frames) to the system. This routine 
also pops all memory frames from the calling process leaving it with none.
