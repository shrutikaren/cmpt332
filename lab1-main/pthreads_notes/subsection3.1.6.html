<P>
Pthreads provides a timer service to time the interval between events. These
timers (called elapsed timers) are manipulated using four routines whose
headers are as follows:
<P>
<PRE><TT>int ResetETimer(int timer)
<P>
int StartETimer( int timer )
<P>
int GetETimer( int timer )
<P>
int StopETimer( int timer )</TT></PRE>
<P>
Each of these routines requires the timer identifier as the single argument.
Timers are numbered starting at zero. The number of timers available is
configurable (currently set at 32).
<P>
<em> ResetETimer()</em> stops the timer (if it was running), and resets
the elapsed time to zero. This is to be called before the timer is used.
ResetETimer() returns 0 on success, or -1 if the timer number is out of
range.
<P>
<em> StartETimer()</em> starts the timer running. If the timer is already
running when StartETimer() is called, the elapsed time is reset to begin
counting again from zero. StartETimer() returns 0 on success, or -1 if the
timer number is out of range.
<P>
<em> GetETimer()</em> returns the amount of time that has elapsed (in terms of
system clock ticks - see Sleep()) over the most recent timed interval. If the
timer is running, the value returned is the number of clock ticks that have
occurred during the interval between the most recent call to StartETimer() and 
this call to GetETimer(). If the timer is not currently running, the value
returned is the number of clock ticks that have occurred during the interval 
between the most recent call to StartETimer() and the most (though later) call 
to StopETimer(). The call to GetETimer() does not change the state of the timer
(i.e. does not alter the time value, start the timer, or stop the timer). If the
timer argument is out of range, a -1 is returned.
<P>
<em> StopETimer()</em> stops the timer and returns the number of clock ticks
during the interval between this call and the most recent call to StartETimer().
This value may be retrieved again using subsequent calls to GetETimer(). If
the timer argument is out of range, or the timer is not currently running, a -1
is returned.
<P>
A process may also obtain the current value of the system clock using 
<em> Time()</em>. Time returns the number of clock ticks since system startup.
The header is as follows:
<P>
<PRE><TT>long Time()</TT></PRE>
