Style Guidelines

1. 80 characters per line. 
2. Use CamelCase for building functions (unless otherwise stated).
3. No dangling pointers. Make sure to initalize pointers to NULL. 
4. Always use braces for if, for, while statements.
5. Test as you go. 
6. Include only the necessary headers to avoid unnecessary dependencies.
7. Write modular code with well-defined functions.
8. Use UPPERCASE for #define, constants, macros.
9. Postfix internal private variables with _ to differentiate from local variables.
10. Use 4 spaces for indentation 
11. Only include the required headers.
12. Use Header gaurds in header files to prevent multiple inclusions of the same file. 
13. precompute values outside a loop whenever possible. 
14. Initialize all values to default. 
15. Avoid unless otherwise stated Macros for Functions. 
16. Whenever possible use error codes to show if the program was SUCCESS or FAILURE. 
17. Check function return values (fopen, malloc). Make sure the memory is allocated before moving on.
18. For every Malloc we need a free to avoid memory leaks.
19. Whenever possible check for NULL before dereferencing.
