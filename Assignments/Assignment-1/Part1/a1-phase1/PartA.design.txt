For Part A, this can be achieved by having three main files namely as follows: 
1. square.h (Header File)
2. square.c (Source File containing the Square Function)
3. partA1.c (The program consisting of multithreading)

The reason why keepRunning was not mentioned inside the headerfile and
initalized was because if the header file is later used with other files that
may have the same variable name, it could lead to errors in the code. Hence,
the global variable keepRunning is limited to inside the partA1.c file only.
