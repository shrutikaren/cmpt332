PART A: Children and Parent Threads    1/9 marks

PARTA::: Design Doc:  0.5/2 marks  

	Windows:	0.5/1.5
  Linux: 0/0.5

  Windows:
	[-1]very verbose but no details
	how will square() be counted correctly?

  UBC/POSIX:
           [-.5] not the details I was looking for, and it defiently is the
  wrong apporach you can't use synchronization. The difference between windows
  and linux is that the parent is now responsible for killing the children
           this causing new challenges that you have to address


PARTA::: Implementation: -1/5 marks


	Windows:  	0/3   
	UBC:		-1/1  
	POSIX:		0/1

  Windows:
  	[-1.5]The design spec says not use any synchronization
	WaitForMultipleObjects() is an excellent choice, but violates the
	requirements

	Unofficial common convention on windows to exit with the error
	value from why you are exiting (i.e. return GetLastError();
	or return ERROR_INVALID_DATA;, etc...)

	GetSystemTime() is there a better way to do this?
	hint:

	[-1]How will the parent thread access count?

	[-.5]no quotes with #include

	[-1]You are not couonting how many times square()
	is run inside square! This is a maditory design feature.

  UBC comments:
              [-.5] no executable called partA2
              [-.1] don't use "" to include local headers
              - don't need signal.h
              [-5] YOU NEED UBC NOT POSIX

  POSIX comments:
                [-.5] no executable called partA3
                [-.1] don't use "" to include local headers
                [-.5] SHOULD NOT BE USING MUTEX, this is synchronization
                - https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pthread_cancel.3.html
                  make sure you're setting up cancel correctly
                  , but cancel is a terrible choice, use kill

PARTA:::: Testing/Test Plan:	1.5/2 marks 
  Plan:
	[-.5]Testing too focused on parsing behaviour
	not runtime behaviour
  Test:
	Evidence of threads
