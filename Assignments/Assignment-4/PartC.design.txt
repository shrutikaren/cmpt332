OVERVIEW
--------

Application that enables real-time text communication between users. We are 
using UDP protocol and RT Threads for concurrency. 

SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
-------------------

NOTE: From the given instructions we are using a Sender/Receiver/Request model 
for coordination.

1. Keyboard Input Thread
2. UDP Input Thread 
3. Screen Output Thread
4. UDP Transmit Thread
5. Server Thread 

THREAD RESPONSIBLEITIES
-----------------------

1. KEYBOARD INPUT THREAD

    o FUNCTION: Read user input from the keyboard without blocking the main 
                process.
    
    o OPERATION: 
        o   Uses non-blocking I/O and the curses library in cbreak mode 
            to read each character as it is typed.
        o   Sends characters to the Server Thread for processing. 

    o SPECIAL SEQUENCE: We plan to use `Ctrl-C` to indicate that the user wants
                        to exit the chat.

    PSEUDO CODE:
    ------------

    keyBoardInputThread():
        char = getch()
        if char != ERROR:
            if char == EXIT_CHARACTER:
                set keepRunning to true
                signal Server Thread to terminate
            else:
                timestamp = get_current_time()
                character_data = { char, timestamp }
                acquire mutex on outgoing_buffer
                add character_data to outgoing_buffer
                release mutex on outgoing_buffer
                signal condition variable for outgoing_buffer
        else:
            sleep for a short duration



2. UDP INPUT THREAD

    o FUNCTION: Listens for incoming UDP datagrams from the network. 
    
    o OPERATION:
        o   Uses non-blocking sockets to receive messages without blocking 
            other threads. 
        o   Parses incoming messages and sends them to the Server Thread for 
            processing.

    o EXTRA:
        o   Handle Messages from different architectures (byte order differences)
        o   Supports character-by-character display by processing each 
            received character.


    PSEUDO CODE:
    ------------ 

    updInputThread():
        while not keepRunning:
            data, addr = recvFrom_nonblocking(udp_socket)
            if data is not empty:
                character_data = deserialize(data)
                acquire mutex on incoming_buffer
                add character_data to incoming_buffer
                release mutex on incoming_buffer
                signal condition varaible for incoming_buffer
            else:
                sleep for a short duration
