<h2>TOTAL MARKS: 100 </h2>
<h1> Introduction</h1>
For this assignment, you are going to use UBC pthreads and RT Threads
to implement synchronization applications and primitives. Also, you
are going to continue to examine the source code for xv6 and make some
additions to its functionality. Please take
note that there are three parts to this assignment, which are
<b>unequally weighted</b>. It would be a mistake to divide up the work
between the two members such that, for example, one did part A and C and 
one did part
B. Not only will this not divide the work evenly, you will be at
a disadvantage when it comes to the exams. The first phase has 10 marks
associated with the makefile and skeleton.<br> 

10 marks for Phase 1, 90 for phase 2.
<h2> Part A: Implement Synchronization Primitives/Applications in xv6 
(30 marks)</h2>
</p>


<p>
In this part of the assignment you will implement synchronization primitives
(semaphores) for xv6 and use them to solve a synchronization problem.
<p>
<b>Note: Write readable code!</b>

</p><p>
In your programming assignments, you are expected to write
well-documented, readable code. There are a variety of reasons to strive
for clear and readable code. Since you will be working in pairs, it will
be important for you to be able to read your partner's code.  Also, since
you will be working on xv6 for the remainder of the semester, you
may need to read and understand code that you wrote several months
earlier. Finally, clear, well-commented code makes your markers happy!

</p><p>
There is no single right way to organize and document your code. It is
not our intent to dictate a particular coding style for this class. The
best way to learn about writing readable code is to read other people's
code. Read the xv6 code, read your partner's code, read the source code
of some freely available operating system. When you read someone else's
code, note what you like and what you don't like. Pay close attention to
the lines of comments which most clearly and efficiently explain what is
going on. When you write code yourself, keep these observations in mind.

</p><p>
Here are some general tips for writing better code:

</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li> Group related items together, whether they are variable   declarations,
lines of code, or functions.
</li><li> Use descriptive names for variables and procedures. Be consistent
with this throughout the program. 
</li><li> Comments should describe the programmer's intent, not the actual
mechanics of the code. A comment which says "Find a free disk block"
is much more informative than one that says "Find first non-zero element
of array."
</li></ul>


</p><p>
For the purposes of the grader, mark any changes you make to the code
with the following comments:

<pre>
/* CMPT 332 GROUP XX Change, Fall 2024 */
</pre>

</p>

<h3>Concurrent Programming with xv6</h3>


<p>For this problem you will be adding more functionality to xv6 that</p>
<ol>
<li>Supports <em>user-level threading</em>, so that concurrency within a 
single
   user-level process is possible, and</li>
<li>Provide a <em>basic synchronization mechanism</em> -- the mutex lock -- 
for said threads to use.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Threading API</h3>


<p>In this part of the assignment, you will design the context switch
  mechanism for a user-level threading system, and then implement
  it. To get you started, your xv6 has two
  files <code>user/uthread.c</code>
  and  <code>user/uthread_switch.S</code>, and a rule in the Makefile
  to build a uthread 
  program. <code>uthread.c</code> contains most of a user-level
  threading package, and code for three simple test threads. The
  threading package is 
  missing some of the code to create a thread and to switch between
  threads.
</p>

<p>You will properly complete the following function to support
  thread creation and subsequently context switching:</p>
<p><code>void thread_create(void (*tmain)());
</code></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This creates a new thread that starts execution at the function 
<code>tmain</code>. The <code>thread_create</code> function is responsible for 
allocating   (using <code>malloc</code>, given in the file "umalloc.c") a
 new user stack.</p>
</li>
</ul>


In <code>user/uthread.c</code>, you will need to
add to <code>thread_schedule</code> to switch between threads. That
switching happens in <code>thread_switch</code>
in <code>user/uthread_switch.S</code>.   You will have to decide where
to save/restore registers; modifying <code>struct thread</code> to
hold registers is a good plan. You'll need to add a call
to <code>thread_switch</code> in <code>thread_schedule</code>; you
can pass whatever arguments you need to <code>thread_switch</code>,
but the intent is to switch from thread <code>t</code> to 
<code>next_thread</code>.  

<br><br>
To allow compilation and execution you will have to add new lines to the
makefile:
<ul>
  <li>Add <code>$U/_uthread\</code> to the list of user programs</li>
  <li>Add the following between the list of user programs and the
    <code>fs.img</code> rule: <pre><code>
$U/uthread_switch.o : $U/uthread_switch.S
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c -o $U/uthread_switch.o $U/uthread_switch.S

$U/_uthread: $U/uthread.o $U/uthread_switch.o $(ULIB)
    $(LD) $(LDFLAGS) -N -e main -Ttext 0 -o $U/_uthread $U/uthread.o $U/uthread_switch.o $(ULIB)
    $(OBJDUMP) -S $U/_uthread > $U/uthread.asm
    </code></pre>
</ul>

<h3>Mutex</h3>
<p>To allow your newly minted threads to coordinate critical sections and safely
share data, you will implement the following functions that expose a mutex
lock. The lock will be implemented internally using a spinlock.</p>
<p><code>int mtx_create(int locked);</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Creates a mutex lock and returns an opaque ID (you might wish to 
<code>typedef</code> a
  separate type for the lock ID, though it isn't strictly necessary). The lock
  starts out in the <code>locked</code> state (binary: true or false).</li>
</ul>
<p><code>int mtx_lock(int lock_id);</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Blocks until the lock has been acquired.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>int mtx_unlock(int lock_id);</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Releases the lock, potentially unblocking a waiting thread. </li>
</ul>
<p>Note that you can then build arbitrarily more sophisticated synchronization
mechanisms (e.g., semaphores) in userspace by leveraging this mutex lock. This is not
required for this assignment.</p>
<h3>Testing</h3>
<p>To test your code, you should write a program that implements the
producer/consumer problem by sharing a bounded buffer between a parent
and child (or sibling) threads, using the mutex as a primitive for implementing
synchronization.  You can implement this without counting
semaphores. Just have the 
buffer size and buffer space as integers that are atomically updated.</p>
<p>Add this program to your codebase and the Makefile, and be sure to 
commit and push it as part of your submission.</p>

<h2> Part B: Implement Monitors with UBC Pthreads Semaphores (20 marks) plus 5 in phase 1</h2>
This library utility is to provide the functions of a monitor facility.
In general, this would require you to implement condition variables
(<code>k</code> condition variables must be
implemented, <code>k</code> specified as a compile-time constant), and the wait
and signal operations. In keeping with the standard terminology, these
operations would be called <span style="font-weight: bold;">MonWait()</span>,
<span style="font-weight: bold;">MonSignal()</span>.&nbsp; Monitors
can be implemented using either semaphores, or traditional IPC mechanisms in
language environments that do not provide this facility, and they
provide an elegant programming model that does not require as much
awareness of the low level support facilities. In this assignment, we
want you to implement Monitors using only the P(), and V() operations.

<p><b>Implementing the Monitor Utilities Library.</b> </p>
<p>In an environment that supports Monitors internally or as an object,
simply placing the procedure inside a monitor object is
sufficient to automatically get mutual exclusion. Since we are
expecting
that applications for this Monitor facility will be written in C, we
have to fake this part. This is done by requiring each monitor
procedure to execute <b>MonEnter()</b>
as its first executable statement, and <b>MonLeave()</b> 
as its final statement before returning.&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p>You will need to implement 4 main procedures: <b>MonEnter(), MonLeave(),
    MonWait(), </b>and<b> MonSignal().&nbsp; </b> 
You will need to use lists from Assignment 1 in order to make this
  work properly.
You *should* be using your list implementation from
Assignment 1. If you are not confident in your list implementation,
please *do not* make a new one. Borrow from a classmate (with
attribution and their permission). I know there are many good
implementations around. 
 Then, this code should be bundled up as a
 library. Create a file called <tt> libMonitor.a</tt> 
 as the last step of your make process for making the library.<br>
</p>
<p>To test the monitor facility, use the readers-writers problem. We
  will supply an initial version of the readers-writers problem
  solution using these facilities.
You can also use this solution as a guide
to how to structure more complex threads applications.

 </p>
<h2>Part C : Chat program using RT Threads IPC (40 marks) 
	+ 5 in phase 1<br>
</h2>
<p>For this part of the assignment you are going to create a simple
"chat"-like facility that enables someone at one terminal to communicate
with another user at another terminal using the UDP transport protocol
  and the RT Threads package. 
<p>To initiate an s-chat session, the users will first agree on two
things:

<ul>
<li>
the machine that each will be running on, and 
<li> the port number&nbsp; each will use.
</ul>
<br>
Say that Fred and Barney want to talk. Fred is on machine "minion12"
and will use port number 30001. Barney is on machine "peon34" and will
use port number 39001. </p>
<p>To initiate s-chat, Fred must type: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; s-chat 30001 peon34 39001 </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Barney must type: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; s-chat 39001 minion12 30001. </p>
<p>The result will be that every <span style="font-weight: bold;">line
</span>typed at each terminal will
appear on all terminals as they are typed along with the time at which
  it was sent from the originator of the message in seconds and
  microseconds. TIME MAY NOT BE SENT AS A STRING. If you want to learn about 
"curses" and "cbreak" on your own, you can alter this slightly so that
every character typed appears on all screens as it is typed, for each
user rather than having to wait for each [return]. If you are
interested,
look in the man pages under "curses" (this is NOT a requirement of the
assignment, but will garner BONUS credit). </p>
<p>A user leaves a session by typing some special character on a line
by itself (or some special sequence that you define by itself on a
line). <br>
</p>
<p>
In our configuration in the lab, <b>only ports 30001 to 40000 are
available</b> for your use. Tuxworld is probably a good partner
machine, but again be sure that you connect to the correct tux machine.</p>

<h3> Expected Process Structure</h3>
This part of the assignment will be done using S/R/R IPC for
coordination. I want you to use 5 threads. One of the threads does  
nothing other than await input from the keyboard. Another thread does
nothing other than await a UDP datagram.
There will also be threads which print characters to the screen, and
which send data to the remote UNIX processes over the network using
UDP. There will be a 5th thread (the Server) that coordinates the
sending of messages. It processes the messages by putting messages
from the keyboard thread on a LIST that are to be transmitted by the
UDP transmit thread. The transmit thread requests messages from the
Server and sends them across the network.


<p>
Again, you will need to use lists
from Assignment 1 in order to make this work properly.  Access to the list
is a critical section.
Imagine, if you will, a slow screen, or slow network. A user could
type many lines before they get sent across the network. These lines must be
buffered in some way.  Thus, there is a list of all the
messages in transit. 
The network sending thread would take an item off the list and send
it, but if there were no items on the list, it will have to
wait. Similarly with the screen printing thread. The server handles
access to both  lists.

<p>Note that the UDP input and keyboard input threads cannot make any
blocking UNIX calls as these would block the entire UNIX process (i.e.
all the threads). You will therefore have to perform non-blocking input
on the keyboard and network reads. This can be done by setting the
respective file descriptors to non-blocking status (see below). </p>
<p><i>Important Note: </i>If you do not set the file descriptor back
to blocking before ending the application, the window from which you
invoked the application may disappear. That would be bad. </p>
<p><i>How to start this part:</i> </p>
<p>First, try out some of the keyboard/screen I/O primitives supplied
by UNIX and try reading from the keyboard without blocking (check the
section 2 man pages under "read", "sendto" and (optionally) "curses"
"cbreak"). To do so, you can either use "select" (look at the man page)
or better yet (i.e. easier to get to work), open your file descriptor
  using the O_NDELAY or O_NONBLOCK flag for non-blocking I/O (again,
  look at the man pages - this time under "open", and "read"). 

<p>Check the man pages (or equivalently, many guides to network
programming available. I
  like <a href="http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/">Beej's 
    Guide to Network Programming</a> listed on the Useful OS Resources page): </p>
<ul>
  <li> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fcntl</li>
  <li> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; socket</li>
  <li> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bind</li>
  <li> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sendto</li>
  <li> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; recvfrom</li>
  <li> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; getaddrinfo</li>
  <li> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; htons, htonl, ntohs,
ntohl</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>
I'm sure I haven't answered all the questions. Some questions are left
to be your judgment. The TAs and I will gladly give help on conceptual
questions and hints on implementation issues, you just have to ask.
<p>
Finally, bring them all together in a RT Threads
application. You will see that the example could have a user on LINUX talking
to a user on a POWER architecture (or possibly NetBSD, or another CPU
architecture, like an ARM or Motorola processor, which may have
different byte orders).  
In particular, you should test your code on the Linux boxes in the lab
as well as on machines of another architecture. We have two machines
available for testing different architectures: <code>cmpt332-arm</code>
 and <code>cmpt332-ppc</code>.

<p>
There should be no version-specific code in your solution. The only
changes between platforms will be in the makefile.<br>

<h2>Extra credit</h2>
<br>
Part A (15 marks): Implement counting semaphores using the mutex primitive.
<br>
Part B (10 marks): Implement the Dining Philosopher's problem in your
monitor, in addition to the Readers-Writers problem.
<br>
Part C (15 marks): Implement multi-person chat, including the fancy screen
manipulation to divide screen area among the various users using curses.
<h2>Testing and Test Plans</h2>
Due to the nature of the programs, providing 'canned' test data to
these programs will not work,
neither will the answers be able to be verified by running a 'diff' of
expected output vs. actual output. The testing that you should do
would be white-box testing from inside the various features. Turn off
the testing features when handing in the assignment. A very valuable
way of testing your implementations is to test your chat programs by
chatting with another implementation from other groups.

<b><big><big>Deliverables - What to hand in:</big></big>&nbsp;</b> <br>
</p>

<p>PHASE 1 (Parts B and C only):</p> 
<p>Skeletons/Stubs are code pieces that have the interface to every
  procedure you have designed, and every thread created, checking the
  parameters, when appropriate. </p>
<p>
Each thread should call the procedures it needs to call, but does not
need to be fully functional. Error codes should be checked from system
calls, but the logic of the program design can be incomplete.</p>

<p>Part B: Monitors using UBC Pthreads Semaphores</p>
<ul>
  <li>Documentation describing your solution strategy, including
  pseudocode in PartB.design.txt. Explain why your solution is correct.
  <li>Monitor.h
  <li>Monitor.c
  <li>reader_writer_monitor.h (can be deduced from the following 2 files)
  <li>reader_writer_monitor.c (provided for you).
  <li>readers_writers.c (provided for you, but you can modify it as
  you see fit, as long as you document this clearly)
  <li>all the source code for the list library (<tt>list_adders.c,
  list_movers.c, list_removers.c, list.h</tt>, properly attributed if
    necessary)
  <li>lines in the makefile to compile the application as 
    <tt>reader_writer_test</tt>, using <tt>libMonitor.a</tt>
    and <tt>liblist.a</tt> as appropriate (that means
    <tt>-lnameoflibrary</tt>).
</ul>

<p>Part C: S-chat using RT Threads IPC<p>
<ul>
	<li>a single C file (called <tt>s-chat.c</tt>)
  </li>
  <li>documentation describing your solution strategy, down to the
level of general pseudocode.</li>
  <li>lines in the makefile for s-chat</li>
</ul>

<p>PHASE 2:</p>

<p>Part A: Threads/Synchronization in xv6</p>
<ul>
  <li><tt>xv6-synch.diff</tt>: a diff file listing all the changes
  to the kernel you made for this assignment (As in A1). 
  <li>tarball of your kernel source, without the git details (named xv6-A2.tar)
  <li>Design document in PartA.design.txt. Brief description of the
  implementation of thread implementation and mutex locks and enough 
    explanation for your synchronization tests.
  <li>Test execution of your modified kernel
  in <tt>xv6-kernel-output.txt.</tt> This will include runs of
  the producer-consumer problem. 
</ul>

<p>Part B: Monitors using UBC Pthreads Semaphores</p>


<p>Fully functional components of the code and updated documentation, 
including test results.</p>

<p>Part C: S-chat using RT Tthreads IPC</p>
<ul>
	<li>a single C file (called <tt>s-chat.c</tt>)
  </li>
  <li>whitebox test-plan and test results. Show that your program works and
  why. Paths through the code should be verified.</li>
  <li>documentation describing your solution strategy, down to the
level of general pseudocode.</li>
  <li>lines in the makefile for s-chat for 3 architectures: x86_64,
  ppc and arm</li>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Source code and lines in the makefile for the list library are also 
  required.

<p>No ._ files from OS X.

<p>Finally, proper git logs are required.
</p>
<p>All of this should be bundled in a .tar file and submitted via
Canvas with no subdirectories in your source code for parts B and C.
For Part A, the tar file of the main source tree for xv6 source code,
 will   be the xv6-riscv directory (named xv6-A2.tar), following the
  same methodology as in A1.
  So, yes, that's a .tar file that contains a .tar file.

<h2>Notes and Warnings:<br>
</h2>
<p>Documentation: All documentation files are to be in UNIX text file
format with lines shorter than 80 characters. Nothing else is
acceptable; nothing else is necessary. There 
will not be diagrams, etc. in your work. This allows the marker to look
at both your code and your documentation in the same tool: vi or emacs.
It speeds the marking and a happy marker is a generous marker.<br>
