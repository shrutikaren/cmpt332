1. uthread.c


2. uthread_switch.S

Logic for uthread_switch.S: 
For the thread structure, we will save the registers specifically the "saved
register" and the stack pointer as well. We don't need to save the "temporary
registers" because those are always caller saved anyway. Caller saved means
that they are saved before the call and restored after the call so we don't need
to spend our resources to worry about them. Since the saved registers are callee
saved, those needs to be saved before our context switches. This is an 
important part of the process when we work with our registers.
