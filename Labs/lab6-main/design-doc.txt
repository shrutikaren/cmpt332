Utilizing the Monitor.c and Monitor.h that I have constructed in Assignment 2.
The Makefile will require the code for pthreads directories: 
UBC_PTHREAD_INCLUDE_DIR = /student/cmpt332/pthreads
UBC_PTHREAD_DIR = /student/cmpt332/pthreads/lib/$(OS)$(ARCH)
UBC_COMPILER_FLAG = -DUSE_UBC_THREADS

In our BestFit.c, I have added the required macros: 
#define maxSleepTime 2
	For this, it seemed like good decision to limit our maxSleepTime 
	between
#define maxAllocation 20480
#define freeProability 0.3
#define numberOfIterations 1000
#define memsize 102400
