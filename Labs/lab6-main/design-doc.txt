Utilizing the Monitor.c and Monitor.h that I have constructed in Assignment 2.
The Makefile will require the code for pthreads directories: 
UBC_PTHREAD_INCLUDE_DIR = /student/cmpt332/pthreads
UBC_PTHREAD_DIR = /student/cmpt332/pthreads/lib/$(OS)$(ARCH)
UBC_COMPILER_FLAG = -DUSE_UBC_THREADS

In my BestFitMonitor.h, I have added the required macros: 
#define maxSleepTime 2
	For this, it seemed like good decision to limit our maxSleepTime 
	between 1 to 5 seconds. Hence, by selection, I decided to go ahead with 
	2 but it could have been 3 too. - subject to change based off of the 
	results obtained. 

#define maxAllocation 20480
	Here, we would want the value not to exceed the total memsize but we 
	would want it large enough so that it is able to process the memory more
	quickly. 

#define freeProability 0.3
	Ideally, I wanted to ensure that it was less than half. It could have 
	been 0.4 or 0.3. The reason for this is that if we picked a higher 
	frequency number such as 0.8 or 0.9, the issue with that is that there
	would be a higher frequency of memory freeing. If we picked a smaller 
	number, it would be an indication of allocation failure and deadlocks 
	as well.
	
#define numberOfIterations 1000
	This is to indicate the frequency of the allocation and freeing of that
	memory.

#define memsize 102400
	This is the total memory size that all have the threads have access to.

#define memAvail 102400
	I have defined the number of available memory that we can use as 102400
	because that is initially the total amount of memory that we can ideally
	use. 

All of these macros are then going to utilized by our BestFit.c. I have also 
defined my functions for the BestFitMonitor.h which involves the following: 

void* BF_Allocate(int size);
void Initialize(void);
void BF_Free(int startAddress, int size);
