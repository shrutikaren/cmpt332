<P>
Pthreads allows processes to put themselves to sleep. It uses a hierarchical
data structure for sleeping processes which provides O(1) timer manipulation.
Two routines are provided for this service: <em> Sleep()</em> and <em> ReSleep()</em>.
The headers for these routines are as follows:
<P>
<PRE><TT>int Sleep( int ticks )
<P>
int ReSleep( PID sleeper, int ticks )</TT></PRE>
<P>
Sleep() suspends the execution of the calling process for a duration of 
<em> ticks</em> (the only parameter) clock ticks. The upper limit of <em> ticks</em> is
0xffff. Any process wanting to sleep longer than this duration will have to make
multiple calls to Sleep(). Sleep() returns 0 on success and -1 on failure (eg. 
if ticks is out of range).
<P>
ReSleep() adjusts the wakeup time of a currently sleeping process. This is 
useful for timer implementations where the sleeping process is to be kept 
sleeping longer, or is to be woken up at once. ReSleep() requires two
parameters: <em> sleeper</em> and <em> ticks</em>. Sleeper is the process identifier
of the sleeping process whose waketime is to be altered. Ticks is the new
sleep duration relative to the time of the ReSleep() call. A ticks value of 0 
has the effect of waking the process immediately. ReSleep() returns 0 on
success and -1 on failure (eg. if the identified process is not found to be
sleeping, or if ticks is out of range).
